        Well, then.<br /><br />It’s been about 18 hours since I wrote my first
        post on this blog. A whole lot has happened since then, haha.<br /><br />I
        realized that my application was still making fetch calls to my local
        MySQL server instead of my AWS RDS instance. I thought this was a simple
        enough fix; all i had to do was update the endpoints in my fetch
        calls.<br /><br />Of course, as so often happens in programming,
        everything broke.<br /><br />For some reason, my server was rejected the
        requests from my front end, even though I was using cors(). (“No
        'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested
        resource.”) I tried everything: specifying my domain manually, disabling
        CORS entirely, rebuilding my project in a different directory, even
        deploying to Google Cloud to see if the problem was with Render.<br /><br />I
        literally spent all day on this and got really frustrated; my code was
        set up perfectly, and after hours of setting up this application in the
        first place, I was being held up by CORS of all things.<br /><br />Eventually,
        I thought to try and build a completely new application with only the
        most basic of api calls, and used the same deployment environment, save
        for the MySQL server. That’s when I finally took a closer look at
        another error message I’d seen in my logs: Error: connect ETIMEDOUT…<br /><br />The
        error was being thrown from the part of my code responsible for
        connecting to my AWS database instance. I’d ignored it till now because
        I thought that it shouldn’t matter; my issue was with CORS, not my
        database, and I could deal with that later. Out of curiosity, however, I
        went back to my original deployment and commented out that code.<br /><br />Man.<br /><br />Everything
        worked as if there hadn’t been an issue in the first place. My best
        guess is that the failure to connect to my database was preventing my
        CORS preflight configuration from working properly.<br /><br />I finally
        had my culprit and I could not have been more ecstatic. I found that I
        hadn’t allowed general access to my AWS database, which is why the
        server was getting hung up on trying to connect to it. I followed the
        steps to allow connections from my server, updated my endpoints, and
        redeployed. And finally, after 18 hours of debugging, my site was up and
        running.<br /><br />I’m sure there’s a lesson to be learned here and I’m
        sure I’ll be appreciative of this experience later. Right now, though? I
        need sleep.<br /><br />Shoutout to Marvin for the help. Let me know if
        you need any referral bonuses.&gt;
